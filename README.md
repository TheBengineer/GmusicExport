This script will move the mp3 files into folders by Artist/Album


INSTRUCTIONS:

Install Python 3.8+ (Tested with 3.8, 3.9.5, 3.11.0, 3.12.0)

Run <code>main.py</code> at least twice. Each run through will catch more files. 

Between runs, you can add mp3 tags to the remaining files to help the program identify them. 

You may also want to clean up the artists and albums in your <code>music-uploads-metadata.csv</code> file.
